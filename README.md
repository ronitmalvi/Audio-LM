# AUDIO LANGUAGE MODELS

## 🧱 Step 1: Foundation in Audio & Speech Processing

Before diving into models, it's important to understand how speech and audio signals work.

### 📚 Key Topics:
- Audio features (MFCC, Mel Spectrograms, Log-Mel)
- Speech production & perception
- Basics of signal processing
